docker inspect and docker logs

docker inspect command:

The docker inspect command is used to obtain detailed information about Docker objects, including containers, images, networks, and volumes.
It provides a JSON-formatted output that contains various details and configuration settings of the specified object.
Syntax: docker inspect [OPTIONS] NAME|ID
Example: docker inspect mycontainer
In this example, mycontainer represents the name or ID of the container you want to inspect.
The docker inspect command will retrieve detailed information about the specified container, such as its configuration, network settings, mounts, and more.


docker logs command:

The docker logs command is used to view the logs generated by a container.
It displays the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) streams produced by the container's processes.
Syntax: docker logs [OPTIONS] CONTAINER
Example: docker logs mycontainer
In this example, mycontainer represents the name or ID of the container whose logs you want to view.
The docker logs command will output the logs generated by the specified container, allowing you to see any application output or error messages.
Both docker inspect and docker logs are valuable commands for troubleshooting, debugging, and gathering information about Docker containers.
