The docker stop command is used to gracefully stop a running Docker container. Here's a short and crisp explanation of the docker stop command:

Explanation:

docker stop is used to stop a running Docker container.
It sends a signal to the container's main process, requesting it to terminate gracefully.
By default, it allows a container 10 seconds to shut down gracefully before forcefully terminating it.
Stopping a container allows it to perform cleanup tasks, save state, and gracefully terminate any processes running inside it.

Syntax:

docker stop [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]

Example:

docker stop mycontainer

In this example:

mycontainer represents the name or ID of the container to be stopped.
The command docker stop mycontainer will send a stop signal to the specified container, allowing it to shut down gracefully.
Please note that stopping a container does not remove it. To remove a stopped container, you can use the docker rm command.
