The docker run command is used to create and start a new container based on a Docker image.

Syntex:
         docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]

Explanation:

docker run: This is the basic command to run a Docker container.
[OPTIONS]: These are optional flags that you can provide to customize the container's behavior. Some common options include:
-d or --detach: Run the container in the background (detached mode).
-p or --publish: Publish container ports to the host.
-v or --volume: Mount a directory or file from the host into the container.
--name: Assign a name to the container.
-e or --env: Set environment variables inside the container.
IMAGE: Specifies the Docker image to use for creating the container. It can be an image name, a repository name, or an image ID.
[COMMAND] [ARG...]: Represents the command or executable to run inside the container, along with any arguments.

Example:

    docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name mycontainer nginx

In this example:

-d runs the container in the background (detached mode).
-p 8080:80 maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 inside the container, allowing access to the container's web server.
--name mycontainer assigns the name "mycontainer" to the running container.
nginx specifies the Docker image to use, in this case, the official Nginx image.

This command would create a new container based on the Nginx image,run it in the background, and map the container's port 80 to the host's port 8080.
As a result, you can access the Nginx web server running inside the container by accessing http://localhost:8080 on your host machine.
