Kubernetes DaemonSet is a Kubernetes resource that ensures that a specific Pod is scheduled and running on every node within a cluster. DaemonSets are primarily used to run system daemons or background tasks that need to be present on all nodes. Let's explore Kubernetes DaemonSet in a simplified yet detailed way, including examples and a diagram.

Here are the key points to understand about DaemonSet:

Pod Placement:

DaemonSets ensure that a copy of a specific Pod is created and scheduled on every node in the cluster.
Each node in the cluster will have its own instance of the Pod managed by the DaemonSet.
If a new node is added to the cluster, the DaemonSet automatically creates and schedules the required Pod on that node.
If a node is removed from the cluster, the DaemonSet terminates the associated Pod on that node.
Use Cases:

Running cluster-wide system daemons: DaemonSets are commonly used to deploy cluster-wide services or daemons that need to be present on every node, such as log collectors, monitoring agents, or network proxies.
Running background tasks: DaemonSets can also be used to schedule and manage background tasks that need to run on all nodes, such as periodic data backups or cleanup processes.
Pod Template:

DaemonSets define a Pod template that serves as a blueprint for creating and scheduling Pods on each node.
The template specifies the Pod's specification, including the container image, resource requirements, environment variables, and other configuration options.

Example:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: my-daemonset
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: my-image:latest
In this example, a DaemonSet named "my-daemonset" is defined.

The selector specifies that Pods managed by this DaemonSet should have the label app: my-app.
The template defines the Pod specification with a single container named "my-container" using the "my-image:latest" image.

In this diagram:

The Kubernetes cluster is represented at the top.
Nodes within the cluster are depicted, with Node A, Node B, and Node C.
Pods managed by the DaemonSet are shown on each node, ensuring that a copy of the specified Pod is scheduled and running on every node.
DaemonSets guarantee that specific Pods are running on each node, making them useful for running system-level tasks or background processes across the cluster
