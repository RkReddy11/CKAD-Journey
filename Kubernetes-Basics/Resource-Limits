Kubernetes Resource Limits allow you to define constraints on the amount of CPU and memory resources that a Pod or container can use within a Kubernetes cluster. Resource limits ensure that Pods or containers do not consume excessive resources, leading to resource starvation or performance issues. Let's explore Kubernetes Resource Limits in a simplified yet detailed way, including examples and a diagram.

Here are the key points to understand about Resource Limits:

Resource Requests vs. Resource Limits:

Kubernetes distinguishes between resource requests and resource limits.
Resource requests represent the minimum amount of resources that a Pod or container requires to run.
Resource limits define the maximum amount of resources that a Pod or container can consume.
Specifying Resource Limits:

Resource limits can be defined at both the Pod level and the container level.
At the Pod level, you can set resource limits that apply to all containers within the Pod.
At the container level, you can set individual resource limits for each container within the Pod.
Resource limits are specified in terms of CPU units (e.g., millicores) and memory units (e.g., bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes).

Example:


spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "1"
        memory: "1Gi"
In this example, the resource limits are set to 1 CPU unit (1 core) and 1 gigabyte of memory for the container named "my-container" within the Pod.

Pod Scheduling Considerations:

When scheduling Pods, Kubernetes takes into account the resource requests and limits specified.
Kubernetes tries to ensure that nodes have enough available resources to satisfy the resource requests of Pods.
Resource limits help prevent Pods from overconsuming resources and impacting the performance and stability of other Pods running on the same node.

In this diagram:

The Kubernetes cluster is represented at the top.
Nodes within the cluster are depicted, each with its available resources (CPU and memory).
Pods are shown running on the nodes, each with its specified resource limits.
Resource limits help ensure that Pods or containers do not consume more resources than allocated, preventing resource starvation and maintaining performance and stability within the cluster.
