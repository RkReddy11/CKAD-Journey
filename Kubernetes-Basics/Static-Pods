Kubernetes Static Pods are Pods that are not managed by the Kubernetes control plane but are directly created and managed by the kubelet daemon running on each node in a Kubernetes cluster. Static Pods provide a way to run Pods without using the typical Kubernetes deployment mechanisms. Let's explore Kubernetes Static Pods in a simplified yet detailed way, including examples and a diagram.

Here are the key points to understand about Static Pods:

Pod Creation and Management:

Static Pods are created and managed by the kubelet on each individual node, independent of the Kubernetes control plane.
The kubelet monitors a specific directory on the node's filesystem, typically /etc/kubernetes/manifests, for static Pod manifests.
Each manifest file in the directory represents a Static Pod, and the kubelet ensures that the Pod is created and maintained according to the manifest's specifications.
If a Static Pod is deleted or fails, the kubelet automatically recreates it to maintain the desired state.

Use Cases:

Running essential system components: Static Pods are often used to deploy critical system components that need to run on every node, such as network plugins, monitoring agents, or log collectors.
Supporting specialized hardware: Static Pods can be used to run Pods that require direct access to specialized hardware resources available on a node, such as GPUs or FPGA devices.
Bootstrapping cluster control plane components: Static Pods are also used during the bootstrap phase of a Kubernetes cluster to deploy initial control plane components before the control plane is up and running.

Manifest Files:

Static Pods are defined using manifest files written in YAML or JSON format, similar to regular Kubernetes Pod manifests.
Each manifest file represents a single Pod and contains the Pod's specification, including container images, resource requirements, labels, and other configuration options.


Example Manifest File (/etc/kubernetes/manifests/my-static-pod.yaml):

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-static-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image:latest
In this example, the manifest file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/my-static-pod.yaml defines a Static Pod named "my-static-pod".

The Pod has a single container named "my-container" using the "my-image:latest" image.

In this diagram:

The Kubernetes cluster is represented at the top.
Node A is depicted.
The Static Pod "my-static-pod" is shown running directly on Node A, managed by the kubelet running on that node.
Static Pods offer a way to run Pods directly on individual nodes, bypassing the usual Kubernetes control plane mechanisms, making them useful for deploying essential system components or supporting specialized hardware requirements.
